Welcome to the Top 20 practice project

The project is a "Top 20" music voting application.

The user will add artists, then add songs.

Then the user will be asked to submit a vote for each song.

The following "Tops" can be displayed:
* The most popular song ever
* the most popular artist ever
* The most popular song and artist of the last week. A week is defined as a period from Monday to Sunday. The top will count the votes from the week that just ended.

Constraints

You need to use [Grails](http://grails.org), the Groovy language, the GSP language for the Web templates, and MySQL as the data store.

Concerns that your solution must address:
* Separation of concerns between model, view, controller, and service layer.
* Tests
* Validation
* Ensuring data integrity
* Database schema creation and migration

Not a concern, i.e. don't worry about these:
* Authentication and authorization
* Preventing vote fraud

Future concerns, not to be addressed right now, but intended to help you create a better design:
* How would you add support for a mobile UI?
* How big does your test suite need to be, to ensure maximum code coverage?
